      <h1>Who is a Sphynx Cat?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong> The Sphynx cat</strong>
        (pronounced SFINGKS, /ˈsfɪŋks/) also known as the Canadian Sphynx, is a
        breed of cat known for its lack of fur. Hairlessness in cats is a
        naturally occurring genetic mutation, and the Sphynx was developed
        through selective breeding of these animals, starting in the 1960s.

          2. Hairless, but from the Cold North
          <span class="facts_text">
            After an Ontario cat gave birth to a hairless kitten in the
            mid-1960s, two separate sets of Sphynx kittens were born to owners
            in Minnesota and Toronto. Thanks to efforts of the cat breeders back
            then, the lineage of Sphynx cats prospered over time. This is not
            just in Canada; Sphynx cats also exist in other parts of the world.

          3. Sphynx Cats Can Get Sunburn
          <span class="facts_text">
            You should bear in mind that due to lack of a dense coat, a Sphynx
            cat’s skin is more sensitive than other cats. So yes, they can get
            sunburnt. They are a warmer breed of cats as well, roughly 4oC
            warmer than average. If you take them out on a scorching summer
            afternoon, they can get overheated. While they can go outside in
            temperate weather, they should mostly be kept as indoor cats.

          4. Sphynx Cats Need Regular Baths
          <span class="facts_text">
            Although a typical cat’s coat acts like a magnet for dust particles,
            pollen, and other substances, a Sphynx cat’s skin produces a lot of
            oil. Oil secretion on the skin of normal cats will help them keep
            their fur sleek, but in the case of Sphynx cats, it forms a greasy
            film on their bodies. Cat experts suggest that Sphynx owners should
            give the cats baths at least once a week to keep them clean, fresh
            and hygienic.

          5. Owning a Sphynx Cat is an Expensive Affair
          <span class="facts_text">
            Unlike regular felines, Sphynx cats need a lot of attention, care
            and food. Sphynx cats are extremely hungry, thanks to their
            incredibly high metabolism, and always have an appetite. They need a
            diet that is high in protein for optimal health. In other words,
            keeping them well-stuffed and healthy means putting aside a bit of a
            larger budget for high-quality cat food.
